# ML Projects

This repository showcases applied data science and machine learning projects. Each project demonstrates key skills such as data cleaning, model building, anomaly detection, feature analysis, fairness assessment etc.

## Projects

1. **Dataset Creation for Kaggle**  
   - Created, documented, and published a clean synthetic dataset.  
   - Skills: Data curation, documentation, Kaggle publishing.

2. **Data Cleaning with Pandas**  
   - Cleaned and preprocessed messy datasets for ML readiness.  
   - Skills: Missing value handling, formatting, duplicates, preprocessing.

3. **Anomaly Detection in User Activity**  
   - Identified abnormal user behaviors using statistical and ML methods.  
   - Skills: Outlier detection, unsupervised ML, data visualization.

4. **Logistic Regression from Scratch**  
   - Built logistic regression manually and with scikit-learn.  
   - Skills: Binary classification, gradient descent, model comparison.

5. **SVM Noise Robustness Study**  
   - Evaluated Support Vector Machine performance under noisy conditions.  
   - Skills: Model robustness testing, noise injection, visualization.

6. **Decision Tree & Fairness Analysis**  
   - Built ID3 decision tree and investigated model biases.  
   - Skills: Decision trees, fairness metrics, ethical ML.
  
7. **KNN with Feature Ablation Study**  
   - Trained a KNN classifier and analyzed feature importance via ablation.  
   - Skills: KNN classification, feature scaling, model evaluation, feature analysis.

## **How to Navigate This Repository**

1. Each task is in a separate folder named with a descriptive name, e.g., `Dataset_Creation_Kaggle`.  
2. Inside each folder, you will find:  
   - A Jupyter notebook implementing the task.  
   - The dataset used.
   - A `README.md` explaining the task, workflow, and insights.  
3. Start by exploring the notebooks in order to follow a progressive learning path.

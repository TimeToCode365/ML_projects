# Logistic Regression : Scratch vs scikit-learn

## Objective
Understand and implement binary classification by building a logistic regression model from scratch and comparing it with scikit-learn’s implementation.

## Dataset
- Heart disease dataset: `heartdisease.csv`  
- Features may include age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and other health indicators  
- Target: Presence or absence of heart disease

## Steps
1. Preprocess the dataset (normalize features, handle missing values if any)  
2. Implement logistic regression from scratch using matrix operations and gradient descent  
3. Train and evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
4. Implement logistic regression using scikit-learn for comparison  
5. Compare the two approaches on:
   - Performance metrics  
   - Training time  
   - Interpretability and implementation complexity  
6. Document observations and insights

## Results
- Logistic regression model implemented from scratch and validated  
- Performance metrics compared against scikit-learn implementation  
- Insights on differences in accuracy, interpretability, and training efficiency

## Skills Demonstrated
- Binary classification and logistic regression fundamentals  
- Gradient descent and matrix operations  
- Model evaluation with classification metrics  
- Comparing custom implementations with library-based approaches

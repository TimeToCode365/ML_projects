# Decision Tree & Fairness Analysis (ID3)

## Objective
Build a decision tree using the ID3 algorithm from scratch and analyze model predictions for potential bias across demographic groups, promoting ethical AI practices.

## Dataset
- Utrecht Fairness Recruitment dataset: `recruitment.csv`  
- Features include age, gender,hiring outcome  
- Target: Whether a candidate was hired or not

## Steps
1. Preprocess the dataset (handle missing values)  
2. Implement the ID3 decision tree algorithm from scratch  
3. Train and evaluate the model using metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score  
4. Analyze feature importance and interpret which features most influence hiring decisions  
5. Conduct fairness analysis:
   - Slice predictions by demographic groups (e.g., gender, age brackets)  
   - Measure fairness using metrics like Demographic Parity and Equal Opportunity  
6. Document observations, potential biases, and ethical implications

## Results
- ID3 decision tree built and evaluated  
- Key features identified influencing hiring decisions  
- Fairness analysis revealed disparities (if any) across demographic groups  
- Recommendations for reducing bias documented

## Skills Demonstrated
- Decision tree implementation (ID3 algorithm) from scratch  
- Model evaluation with classification metrics  
- Fairness assessment and ethical AI practices

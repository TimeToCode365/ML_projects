# Anomaly Detection in User Activity

## Objective
Detect unusual patterns in user activity logs to identify potential anomalies or suspicious behavior, using both statistical and machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
- Activity logs: `anomaly_detection.csv`  
- Features may include timestamps, user IDs, actions, and other behavioral metrics

## Steps
1. Load and explore the dataset to understand normal behavior trends  
2. Visualize data to identify patterns and potential anomalies  
3. Apply statistical methods for anomaly detection (IQR)  
4. Apply unsupervised ML techniques (Isolation Forest)  
5. Compare anomalies detected by each method  
6. Prepare a final report highlighting top suspicious behaviors with evidence

## Results
- Detected and visualized anomalous user behaviors  
- Identified top anomalies with supporting statistical and ML evidence  
- Developed insights for behavior profiling and potential risk assessment

## Skills Demonstrated
- Anomaly detection using statistical and ML methods  
- Data visualization for behavioral analysis  
- Understanding unsupervised learning techniques  
- Investigative reporting and data-driven storytelling
